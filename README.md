## Wandering around America with Mark Twain

This is my contribution for NaNoGenMo 2020. It was written in December 2019, mostly because I always end up being way too busy in November to do a NaNoGenMo project.

The code extracts U.S. place names from four Mark Twain novels, and then assembles driving directions to go from each place to the next one.

- `fetch_data.py` parses the Mark Twain texts, makes some API calls and saves all the Google Maps data.
- `novelize.py` produces the "novel"
- you can see the end result at `novel.txt`
